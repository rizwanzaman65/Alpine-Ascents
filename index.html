                    People have been fascinated by and drawn to mountains for ages—and also terrified of them, not
                    incidentally. The modern sport of mountaineering/mountain climbing kicked off in the Alps of Europe
                    during the 18th and 19th centuries, and these days has reached just about every corner of vertically
                    inclined terra firma—though given the multitude of remote high mountains from Alaska to Antarctica,
                    and the multitude of routes on each mountain, there are still so many fresh challenges left to
                    tackle.
                    <br><br>
                    Here at Mountain House, we're proud to have fueled an awful lot of alpinists over the decades—and
                    always excited to think of how many dazzling mountainscape backdrops our meals have been cooked
                    before!

                    Today we're taking a look at some of the greatest achievements in the history of modern alpine
                    climbing, from pioneers of its early era to contemporary adventurers. These are presented in no
                    particular order, though we'll kick off with a few of the early feats in the Alps that helped lay
                    the groundwork for climbs in other corners of the world—including the skyscraping heights of the
                    Himalaya and the Karakoram.

                    The highest mountain in the Alps, 15,774-foot Mont Blanc on the border of Italy and France was first
                    climbed in 1786 by Michel-Gabriel Paccard and Jacques Balmat, who earned a reward for the feat
                    offered by the scientist and mountaineer Horace Bénédict de Saussure. This climb is among the
                    formative ones to open the modern age of mountaineering.





                    <br><br><br><br>

                    <h5>2. The Matterhorn </h5>

                    <img src="img/pic125.jpg" width="100%" height="300px">
                    <br><br>
                    The mighty tooth of the Matterhorn (15,203 feet) in the Pennine Alps, one of the most famous and
                    striking peaks in the world, was a coveted summit during the golden age of mountaineering in the
                    Alps. Edward Whymper’s party earned the honors for the first successful climb in 1865.




                    <br><br><br><br>

                    <h5>3. The Eiger North Face</h5>

                    <br><br>
                    While the 13,015-foot Eiger was first climbed in 1858, its yawning North Face—the Nordwand—remained
                    a terrifying and elusive goal for climbers long afterward. A team of German and Austrian
                    mountaineers led by Heinrich Harrer finally scaled this giant wall, nearly 6,000 feet high, in
                    1938–surviving an avalanche along the way.

                    <br><br>
                    The 29,029-foot horn of Mount Everest had been determined the tallest peak in the world by the early
                    1850s, but its summit would remain untrodden for a century or so—at least officially—until New
                    Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tibetan Tenzing Norgay reached the top on the morning of May 29th,
                    1953. The route they took via the southeast ridge included a risky surmount of a rock eminence just
                    below the summit that became known as the “Hillary Step,” an iconic climbing landmark mostly
                    destroyed in the devastating Gorkha earthquake of 2015.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the great unanswered questions in mountaineering history is whether the British climbers
                    George Mallory and/or Andrew Irvine reached the summit of Mount Everest on the 1924 attempt that
                    took their lives. A 1999 expedition to Everest headed by Eric Simonson found the body of Mallory at
                    close to 27,000 feet on the north face of the peak; Irvine’s remains have never been definitively
                    located.

                    <br><br>
                    Hillary and Norgay’s successful summiting of Everest was followed a year later by the first ascent
                    of the world’s second-highest peak, 28,261-foot K2, by the Italians Achille Compagnoni and Lino
                    Lacedelli. Located in the Karakoram range on the China-Pakistan border, K2 is the more technically
                    challenging climb compared to Everest and remains notorious for its danger.

                    The “Eight-Thousanders” constitute the world’s 14 mountain peaks that exceed 8,000 meters (roughly
                    26,250 feet), Everest and K2 obviously included. The first of the Eight-Thousanders to be climbed
                    was 26,545-foot Annapurna in the Nepal Himalaya, scaled in 1950 by a French expedition led by
                    Maurice Herzog.

                    <br><br>
                    The Italian alpinist Reinhold Messner, widely regarded as one of the greatest mountaineers of all
                    time, holds more than one superlative record on Mount Everest. Along with Peter Habeler, he was the
                    first to scale the world’s highest peak without the aid of supplemental oxygen, a feat they achieved
                    in 1978

                    <br><br>
                    Two years later, Messner made headlines on Everest again by completing the first solo ascent of this
                    greatest of peaks via the North Ridge route.



                    <br><br><br><br>

                    <h5>9. First Woman to Reach the Top of Everest (and Land All Seven Summits)</h5>

                    <br><br>
                    The first female climber to summit Everest was Junko Tabei of Japan, who did so in 1975. Junko was
                    also the first woman to climb all of the Seven Summits: that is, the highest peaks on each
                    continent.



                    <br><br><br><br>

                    Richard Bass was the first to climb those continental crowns, checking the seventh off his
                    list—Everest—in 1985. Besides Mount Everest, Bass’s Seven Summits included 22,837-foot Aconcagua in
                    the South American Andes, 20,310-foot Denali in Alaska (the North American high point), 18,510-foot
                    Mount Elbrus (the European high point), 16,050-foot Mount Vinson (the Antarctic high point), and
                    7,310-foot Mount Kosciuszko (the Australian high point).

                    an achievement he earned in 1986. He also made all these climbs without the use of supplemental
                    oxygen, just for good measure.

                    Just this year, another whopper of a mountaineering record was set by the Nepalese climber Nirmal
                    “Nims” Purja, who managed to summit all 14 Eight-thousanders in one season. He kicked off this
                    challenge—called “Project Possible 14/7,” the latter number referring to the seven months he
                    intended to work within—in April 2019 with a climb of Annapurna, and he wrapped it in October atop
                    Shishapangma.
                    <br><br>
                    As he carried out this remarkable undertaking, Purja also set several other records, including
                    climbing the world’s three tallest peaks (Everest, K2, and 28,169-foot Kanchenjunga) in the shortest
                    window ever and scaling Everest, Lhotse (27,940 feet), and Makalu (27,838 feet) within a record 48
                    hours.

                    Given the incomparable remoteness of Antarctica, it’s not so surprising that the ice continent’s
                    high point of Mount Vinson wasn’t even discovered until 1958. This loftiest peak in the Sentinel
                    Range was first climbed eight years later by a team headed by Nicholas Clinch.

                    In 1990, Tim Macartney-Snape of Australia covered some major ground by climbing Mount Everest from a
                    starting point at sea level on the Bay of Bengal, and he did so without using supplemental oxygen.

                    border, the Devils Thumb is one of the legendary elite climbs in North America: a remote,
                    weather-blasted, freakily sheer horn. It was first climbed in 1946 by Clifford Schmidtke, Bob Craig,
                    and Fred Beckey, whose reputation logging first ascents on the continent—including a whole slew of
                    Pacific Northwest climbs, from Mount Hood’s Yocum Ridge to the Picket Range in the North Cascades—is
                    unmatched.

                    The Himalayas mountains surrounded the major part of the subcontinent in the form of the head from
                    the Northern side. The mountains are expanded up to Gilgit. The name of one of the peaks of this
                    range is Nanga Parbat. Its average altitude is 8126 metres. The Himalayas protect our plains from
                    the cold wind of middle Asia. Moreover, they hinder the monsoon winds coming from the Arabian sea
                    and the gulf Of Bengal which cause rains. Most of the high peaks in this range are permanently
                    covered with snow. In the spring and the summer, the ice melts and provide water to our rivers. On
                    the southern hills of these mountains, there are forests of valuable Timber, the hill stations and
                    health resorts of Pakistan like Murree, Nathia Gali and valleys of Kaghan are situated in this
                    range. The valley of Kashmir also offers a beautiful view at the foot of these mountains.

                    Alpine shelters have been perched up in the mountains for generations, providing safe haven for
                    climbers
                    during inclement weather or simply a spot for day hikers to rest and enjoy the views. But the
                    shelters
                    of today are no longer basic structures resembling log cabins or metal sheds. Contemporary
                    architects
                    have defied the challenges of climate and terrain with spectacular designs that enhance the
                    landscape
                    and, thanks to eco-friendly features, help protect their surrounding habitats. We’ve gathered some
                    of
                    the most architecturally daring alpine shelters from Switzerland to Slovenia so you can visit
                    without

                    Completed in 2013 at 10,682 feet above sea level, the Tracuit mountain hut is located between a
                    cliff
                    and a glacier, which inspired its shape and design. Savioz Fabrizzi Architectes lined the south
                    façade
                    with windows and solar panels to capture energy and heat, while the other sides are covered in
                    stainless
                    steel to reflect the scenery. The timber-clad interior contains 12 dormitories accommodating 116
                    people
                    and includes a refectory and a professional kitchen.

                    Foundation’s artist residency program. The shelter has space for one person and features a fireplace

                    Rosa

                    Students from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design teamed with OFIS Architects and
                    engineering firm AKT II on the shelter, which was built to replace an existing 50-year-old
                    structure.
                    The design was inspired by the traditional architecture of Slovenia and consists of three modules
                    that
                    were constructed off-site and transported via helicopter. The interior includes accommodations for
                    eight
                    mountaineers, with spaces for storage, food prep, socializing, and sleeping.

                    cabin and a secondary emergency hut. Norwegian firm Jarmund/Vigsnæs AS Arkitekter MNAL used local
                    timber
                    in the construction and kept the design simple. Solar power provides interior lighting, and heat is
                    supplied by two stoves with exterior chimneys devised to mimic the shape of the mountains beyond.

                    The Himalayas mountains surrounded the major part of the subcontinent in the form of the head from
                    the Northern side. The mountains are expanded up to Gilgit. The name of one of the peaks of this
                    range is Nanga Parbat. Its average altitude is 8126 metres. The Himalayas protect our plains from
                    the cold wind of middle Asia. Moreover, they hinder the monsoon winds coming from the Arabian sea
                    and the gulf Of Bengal which cause rains. Most of the high peaks in this range are permanently
                    covered with snow. In the spring and the summer, the ice melts and provide water to our rivers. On
                    the southern hills of these mountains, there are forests of valuable Timber, the hill stations and
                    health resorts of Pakistan like Murree, Nathia Gali and valleys of Kaghan are situated in this
                    range. The valley of Kashmir also offers a beautiful view at the foot of these mountains.

                    In the Northern mountain parts of Pakistan, winter is very severe. Most areas are covered with snow,
                    the temperature falls even below the freezing point.

                    Recently, the climbing community has expanded rapidly, with hundreds of thousands of new people
                    learning the ropes each year at climbing gyms and crags around the world.
                    <br><br>
                    While climbing is certainly becoming more and more popular, there are still plenty of people out
                    there who think that Alex Honnold-esque free soloing is the only type of climbing.
                    <br><br>
                    Contrary to popular belief, however, climbing up El Cap without a rope is not how the vast majority
                    of climbers like to spend their time on the rock.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, there are so many different varieties of climbing, many seasoned climbing vets don’t even
                    understand the nuances between the many climbing disciplines.

                    <br>
                    Traditional, or trad climbing, as it’s affectionately known, is essentially the original kind of
                    climbing.
                    <br><br>
                    Part adventure, part sport, a trad climber places and removes all of the gear that they need to
                    protect themselves on the rock.
                    <br><br>
                    Traditional climbing protection generally involves gear such as cams (spring-loaded camming devices,
                    or SLCDs), nuts/chocks, hexes, and tricams, which a climber must place into cracks and other
                    features in the rock to protect themselves in the event of a fall.
                    <br><br>
                    Two Male Climbers Trad Climbing
                    Traditional climbing is often thought of as an environmentally ethical form of climbing because trad
                    climbers try not to leave any gear behind in the rock.
                    <br><br>
                    But, it’s important to note that the first trad climbers left behind innumerable pieces of “fixed”
                    protection, such as pitons, which were placed while climbing but not removed.
                    <br><br>
                    These days, most trad climbers adhere to the “clean climbing” ethics espoused by Patagonia founder
                    Yvon Chouinard and climbing great Royal Robbins, which means that protection is removed from the
                    rock wherever possible.
                    <br><br>
                    Many climbers view trad as the ultimate kind of climbing because the trad climber must be wholly
                    self-sufficient on a route and cannot rely on pre-placed anchors or gear to protect them.
                    <br><br>
                    Essentially, this self-sufficiency is what differentiates trad climbing from other disciplines, like
                    sport climbing.
                    <br><br>
                    While traditional climbs can be found at roadside crags, they are often found in remote locales, far
                    in the backcountry, where adventure prevails on big mountain peaks.
                    <br><br><br><br>

                    <h5>2. Sport Climbing</h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/pic148.avif" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike trad climbing, where a climber must place their own protection, sport climbing takes place on
                    pre-bolted crags where the focus is more on the physicality of the climb than on self-sufficiency.
                    <br><br>
                    Generally speaking, a sport climber starts at the bottom of a route equipped with little more than a
                    rope, harness, and quickdraws.
                    <br><br>
                    As they move up the wall, they clip into fixed protection, usually bolts, which are somewhat evenly
                    spaced to protect the climber throughout the route.
                  

                    <br><br><br><br>

                    <h5>3. Bouldering</h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/pic149.webp" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Bouldering is pretty much what it sounds like - it’s a type of climbing that takes place on
                    boulders, rather than on crags or cliffs.
                    <br><br>
                    Many climbers believe bouldering is the “purest” form of the sport as anyone with shoes can jump
                    onto a boulder “problem” without the need for belayers and protection.
                    <br><br>
                    This also means it’s a great place for people to start climbing as it needs very little gear or
                    expertise. We covered the rock climbing essentials in one of our earlier articles.

                    <h5>4. Top Rope Climbing</h5>

                    <br>
                    If you’re new to climbing, chances are you’ll start your life in the vertical world on a top rope
                    climb. When top roping, the climbing rope is attached to an “anchor” at the top of the climb, which
                    is designed to catch a climber’s fall, should they slip.

                    <h5>5. Aid Climbing</h5>

                    Aid climbing involves the use of gear to propel a climber up a route.
                    <br><br>
                    Unlike “free” climbing, where a climber relies only on their own skill to move up a route - with
                    gear placed solely for protection - while climbing, a climber will pull on or step on gear to move
                    up the wall.

                    <h5>6. Big Wall Climbing</h5>

                    <br>

                    The main difference between big wall climbing and all other types of climbing is that big wall
                    climbers ascend cliffs that are many hundreds, if not thousands, of meters tall, which can take days
                    or weeks to climb, while most other climbers stick to single or half-day objectives.
                    <br><br>
                    Big wall climbs are inherently “multi-pitch” routes, which means that they are more than a single
                    rope length long.
                    <br><br>
                    While not all multi-pitch routes are big wall routes, big wall climbs tend to be dozens of pitches
                    long and take a number of days to complete.

                    <h5>7. Ice Climbing</h5>

                    Ice climbing is a type of climbing where a climber ascends ice using specialized pieces of gear,
                    which allows them to make upward progress on an otherwise slippery surface.
                    <br><br>
                    Using ice tools, crampons, and ice screws, ice climbers can make their way up frozen waterfalls and
                    frozen cliffs during the winter months.
                    <br><br>
                    For many climbers, ice climbing is just a great way to stay in shape for rock climbing during the
                    colder months of the year, but for others, it’s their preferred activity.

                    <h5>8. Alpine Climbing</h5>

                    Alpine climbing is a sort of catch-all name for climbing that happens in remote, higher elevation
                    locations.
                    <br><br>
                    Generally speaking, alpine climbs involve a significant approach, or hike, into the mountains and
                    many of these climbs tend to be quite committing.
                    <br><br>

                    <h5>9. Mixed Climbing and Dry Tooling</h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/pic155.jpg" width="100%">

                    <br>
                    Mixed climbing and dry tooling are the little-known step-siblings of the ice climbing world.
                    <br><br>
                    For the most part, the equipment used in both mixed and ice climbing is the same, the only
                    difference is that mixed climbers climb on both rock and ice.
                    <br><br>
                    The best way to think of mixed climbing (also known as dry tooling if no ice is involved) is to
                    consider it a hybrid discipline.
                    <br><br>
                    Climbers don ice climbing gear but will climb routes that fall somewhere between a rock climb and an
                    ice climb.

                    <h5>10. Free Soloing</h5>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Thanks to the global media of the digital age, when the general public thinks of rock climbing, they
                    often picture a scraggly climber ascending a huge cliff with nothing but shoes and a chalk bag.
                    <br><br>
                    This type of climbing, known as free soloing, is practised by climbers who forgo protective
                    equipment of any sort while on a route.
                    <br><br>
                    Free soloing is similar to bouldering, as no ropes are used in either discipline, but in soloing,
                    one climbs much higher than they would while bouldering.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, a fall during a solo would likely be fatal, or, at the very least, cause some serious injury.
                    <br><br>
                    We placed the film Free Solo in our top ten climbing movies of all time, the first feature-length
                    movie chronicling Alex Honnold’s solo ascent of El Capitan in 2018.

                    <br>
                    Deep water soloing (also known as psicobloc) combines the beauty of moving naturally over rock
                    without cumbersome gear with stunning seascapes.
                    <br><br>
                    Deep water soloists seek out stunning cliffs that overhang lakes and calm bays where they can climb
                    and push their physical limits without a rope.
                    <br><br>
                    Deep water soloing tends to take place on high difficulty routes where falls are likely.

                    <h5>12. Speed Climbing</h5>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Speed climbing is a climbing discipline that’s generally found within the world of climbing
                    competitions. As one might imagine, in speed climbing, speed is the ultimate priority.
                    <br><br>
                    During speed climbing competitions, all climbers race up a given route on an artificial climbing
                    wall, trying to nab first place with the fastest time.
                    <br><br>
                    While there is no set difficulty for the route, most people who can climb at least 5c (5.10a)
                    wouldn’t have much of a problem on a speed route.
                    <br><br>
                    Plus, all of the plastic holds on speed climbing routes are the same combination of a jug, pinch,
                    and sloper, so it’s all about which part of the hold you grab.

                    The Himalayas mountains surrounded the major part of the subcontinent in the form of the head from
                    the Northern side. The mountains are expanded up to Gilgit. The name of one of the peaks of this
                    range is Nanga Parbat. Its average altitude is 8126 metres. The Himalayas protect our plains from
                    the cold wind of middle Asia. Moreover, they hinder the monsoon winds coming from the Arabian sea
                    and the gulf Of Bengal which cause rains. Most of the high peaks in this range are permanently
                    covered with snow. In the spring and the summer, the ice melts and provide water to our rivers. On
                    the southern hills of these mountains, there are forests of valuable Timber, the hill stations and
                    health resorts of Pakistan like Murree, Nathia Gali and valleys of Kaghan are situated in this
                    range. The valley of Kashmir also offers a beautiful view at the foot of these mountains.

                    In the west, there is a mountain range that begins from the Hindu Kush mountain range and is mostly
                    spread from north to south. Hill of the Swat, the white mountain hill of Waziristan, Suleman
                    mountain Kirther mountain are located in this range. Mountains are mostly dry and Barren. There are
                    important passes and rivers in these mountain ranges. Khyber Pass, Kurram Pass, Tochi Pass, Gomal
                    Pass and Bolan pass are important passes. Important rivers of this area are the Swat river, the
                    Kurram river, the Gomal river, the Bolan river, the hub river and the Lyari River. The Peshawar
                    Cantt and the Quetta Cantt are located near Khyber pass and the Bolan pass respectively. This pass
                    is served as transit routes between Afghanistan and Pakistan for the purpose of trade and travel.

                    Cantt and the Quetta Cantt are located near Khyber pass and the Bolan pass respectively. This pass
                    is served as transit routes between Afghanistan and Pakistan for the purpose of trade and travel.

                    In the Northern mountain parts of Pakistan, winter is very severe. Most areas are covered with snow,
                    the temperature falls even below the freezing point.

                        of
                        awareness.

                        A lack of awareness could be due to overconfidence. Sometimes a little knowledge is more
                        dangerous
                        than no knowledge. You might think you know it all and fail to heed advice from people who might
                        just know better.

                    Mountain climbing is an inherently dangerous activity, and you need to be aware of the dangers
                    before
                    you go out.
                    So, what are the main risks in mountain climbing? <b> Falling, avalanche danger, exposure to the
                        elements,
                        and altitude sickness are among the most prevalent risks that you’ll face while mountaineering,
                        although
                        that’s far from a comprehensive list.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    There’s a whole host of mountain climbing risks that you’ll have to face if you decide to take up
                    this
                    sport. Some of them (like falling and exhaustion) you’ll have to content with every time you go
                    mountain
                    climbing, while others (like altitude sickness) will only become relevant once you start pushing the
                    boundaries on some of the hardest mountains in the world. Now, this article isn’t meant to dissuade
                    you
                    from mountain climbing (I do it all the time, and I love it), but rather to make you aware of the
                    dangers so that you can plan for them!
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>The Dangers of Mountain Climbing</h4>
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="img/pic42.png" width="100%">
                    <br><br>
                    Even though I’ve spent most of my life climbing mountains, I still don’t think that I was able to
                    create
                    a fully comprehensive list including all of the dangers that you’ll face. With that being said,
                    though,
                    I have 20 main ones that you should be planning for:
                    <br><br>
                    Falling: Maybe the most common danger, and one that almost everyone is afraid of.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Avalanches:</b> Avalanches can hit you at any time, and even the best mountaineers in the world
                    sometimes succumb to them.<br><br>
                    <b>Weather:</b> Weather patterns in the mountains change quickly, and you can find yourself stuck if
                    the
                    conditions suddenly turn.<br><br>
                    <b>Exposure:</b> Spending tens of hours in the beating sun or freezing cold can start to mess with
                    your
                    body and brain (I recently dropped a rappel device due to heat stroke).<br><br>
                    <b>Hypothermia:</b> Spending too long in the cold will cause your body to start to shut
                    down.<br><br>
                    <b>Altitude sickness:</b> Not getting enough oxygen to your brain can muddle your thinking and cause
                    fever-like symptoms<br><br>
                    <b>Pulmonary Edema:</b> A specific type of altitude sickness where blood builds up in your
                    lungs.<br><br>
         
                    <h4>Falling</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic43.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>What it is:</b> The risk of losing your purchase on the mountain in a steep section and having
                    gravity do the rest.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Above five feet, you might injure yourself in a fall; above 20, there’s a
                    very real chance that you could die.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it: </b>Strong mental capacity, navigation, and knowing your limits are all
                    important
                    factors to avoid falling. Wearing a helmet can lessen the impact of a fall.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   
                    <h4>Avalanches</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic45.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>What it is:</b> Massive packs of snow that come loose from mountains and slide down, sometimes
                    for
                    thousands of feet, at almost 100 miles per hour.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Avalanches can bury you alive in snow and then trap you there until you
                    suffocate (that’s if they don’t crush you to death first).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> There are two steps to avoiding avalanches: proper planning (not venturing
                    into
                    severe avalanche terrain) and proper recovery (having the right tools and partners to dig you out if
                    you
                    ever do get trapped).

                    <br><br>
                    <h4>Weather</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic46.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>What it is:</b> The risk of sudden weather changes (usually in the form of storms), which happen
                    often in the mountains.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Storms can change the conditions you’re in, which makes your travelling
                    harder and may expose you to the elements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> Good planning and preparation are the only way to avoid this danger. You
                    should
                    know the weather report for your specific mountain before you leave the house, and you should always
                    carry one extra layer of clothing on you (and one extra meal in case you get stranded).
                   
                    <h4>Exposure</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic47.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What it is:</b> Being subject to the weather for too long, be it hot or cold.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Staying outside for too long in extreme conditions can mess with your
                    body’s
                    ability to function and your brain’s ability to think.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> Again, there’s nothing to do except to over-plan and over-prepare. Bring
                    extra
                    layers if it’s supposed to be cold, and extra water if it’s supposed to be hot.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   
                    <h4>Hypothermia</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic48.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What it is:</b> The damage done to your body when you spend too long in the cold.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous: </b>Symptoms of hypothermia start with losing feeling in your digits, but
                    they
                    can progress to frostbite and eventually organ failure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> I’m starting to sound like a broken record here, but you need to plan if you
                    want to avoid hypothermia.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hypothermia is one of the main dangers that mountain climbers have to contend with. When you spend
                    too
                    long in the cold, your blood gets thick and your body eventually starts to shut down, which can have
                    some pretty disastrous consequences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Avoiding this comes down to four things:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                 
                    <h4>Altitude Sickness</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic49.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What it is:</b> A lack of oxygen to your brain caused by high altitudes (usually above 10,000
                    feet)
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Altitude sickness can cause dizziness, fatigue, flu-like symptoms,
                    weakness,
                    and a lack of critical thinking ability.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> Proper acclimatization is really the only way to properly avoid altitude
                    sickness. This means going up the mountain in small chunks and descending again at night so that you
                    can
                    sleep at lower altitudes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Altitude sickness is one of the largest threats faced by mountain climbers, especially as you start
                    getting into more technical mountaineering. It can slowly break down your body and make it
                    impossible
                    for you to even think straight.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While people often associate mountain sickness with extreme peaks liker Everest and K2, it can
                    actually
                    happen at much lower altitudes; when I climbed Mount Whitney in California a couple of years ago, it
                    was
                    one of the risks we had to content with (for context, Whitney is 14,500 feet tall and is the highest
                    mountain in the lower 48).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Avoiding it is a matter of ascending tall mountains slowly, over a period of days. Alternatively,
                    you
                    can carry bottled oxygen, though this is usually reserved for extreme circumstances.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    If going up over the course of several days isn’t an option (we only had one day to climb Whitney,
                    for
                    example), all you can really do is be aware of the threat of altitude sickness, be on the lookout
                    for
                    the symptoms, and be ready to retreat if you or any of your partners begin to show them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema</h4>
                    <b>What it is:</b> A buildup of blood in your lungs
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> A pulmonary edema can make it difficult to breath; if this progresses too
                    far, you won’t be able to get any air into your lungs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> The only cure is to get to a lower altitude. If you have bottled oxygen,
                    giving
                    it to the person may help, but <b>descending immediately is the only way to save their life.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
             
                    <h4>Exhaustion</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic50.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What it is:</b> Fatigue in your muscles caused by long periods of high exertion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous: </b>Fatigue makes it harder to operate. You’re more likely to trip and fall,
                    more
                    likely to forget something, and more likely to collapse from exhaustion.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it: </b>Much like gambling, you need to know your limit and stay within it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Fatigue may not seem like a big deal, but it’s something that every mountain climber needs to be
                    aware
                    of. On long, demanding trips, you run a very serious risk of your body beginning to break down.

                    <br>
                    Everyone has a physical limit of what they’re capable of; if you try to push past this physical
                    limit,
                    you might find your body refusing to go any farther.

                    <h4>Rockfall</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic51.jpg" width="100%">

                    <br>
                    <b>What it is:</b> Chunks of rock that come loose from above you
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Even a small rock can break bones or cause serious brain damage if it
                    hits
                    you!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> Wear a helmet and make good decisions
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rockfall is another one of those hazards that can be hard to mitigate, because it’s not really
                    within
                    your control. Rocks sometimes come loose due to gravity, erosion, or other climbers, and there’s
                    little
                    you can do to avoid it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because of that, I would highly recommend having a helmet with you whenever you go mountain
                    climbing,
                    and you need to put it on any time you think you’re in an area where rockfall may be a possibility.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Learning to recognize such an area is a matter of experience, but you should look for:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Terrain that’s steeper than 40 degrees
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    High-trafficked areas
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Loose rocks where you are, or rocks strewn around (could be a sign that lots of rocks fall from
                    above
                    and land in that vicinity)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Changing of seasons (rockfall is most common in the spring)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Trips reports are also a great source of information on which routes may be more subject to
                    rockfall.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br><br>
                    <h4>Icefall</h4>
                    <img src="img/pic52.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What it is:</b> Chunks of ice that come loose from the mountain
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> For the exact same reason as rockfall.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> The exact same principles apply. You need to wear your helmet and make good
                    choices.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    All of the dangers of falling rocks are, unsurprisingly, also present with falling ice.

                    <br>
                    <b>What it is:</b> A temporary condition that causes you to lose your vision due to too much light
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Going blind on a mountain side makes most things (like walking, climbing,
                    and
                    route finding) almost impossible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How to avoid it:</b> Sunglasses, mountaineering glasses, or ski goggles to shield you from the
                    glare.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> If you fall into a crevasse (which are often covered in a thin layer of
                    snow
                    and, therefore, invisible), you might die on impact, break a bone, or become stuck.

                    loose, your ice axe snapping, or a rope being cut).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Why it’s dangerous:</b> Mountain climbers rely on their gear to safely see them through various
                    situations. Without that gear, it’s easy to become stranded.

                    The Himalayas mountains surrounded the major part of the subcontinent in the form of the head from
                    the Northern side. The mountains are expanded up to Gilgit. The name of one of the peaks of this
                    range is Nanga Parbat. Its average altitude is 8126 metres. The Himalayas protect our plains from
                    the cold wind of middle Asia. Moreover, they hinder the monsoon winds coming from the Arabian sea
                    and the gulf Of Bengal which cause rains. Most of the high peaks in this range are permanently
                    covered with snow. In the spring and the summer, the ice melts and provide water to our rivers. On
                    the southern hills of these mountains, there are forests of valuable Timber, the hill stations and
                    health resorts of Pakistan like Murree, Nathia Gali and valleys of Kaghan are situated in this
                    range. The valley of Kashmir also offers a beautiful view at the foot of these mountains.

                    In the west, there is a mountain range that begins from the Hindu Kush mountain range and is mostly
                    spread from north to south. Hill of the Swat, the white mountain hill of Waziristan, Suleman
                    mountain Kirther mountain are located in this range. Mountains are mostly dry and Barren. There are
                    important passes and rivers in these mountain ranges. Khyber Pass, Kurram Pass, Tochi Pass, Gomal
                    Pass and Bolan pass are important passes. Important rivers of this area are the Swat river, the
                    Kurram river, the Gomal river, the Bolan river, the hub river and the Lyari River. The Peshawar

                    <b>Climbing Techniques: Using Your Feet</b>
                    <img src="img/pic66.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Feet are the foundation of climbing. Lots of beginners try to pull themselves up the wall and
                    quickly
                    tire out. Think about climbing a ladder—you don’t pull yourself up, you step up, and use your arms
                    and
                    hands for balance. It’s the same in climbing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Basic techniques for using your feet are edging and smearing:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Edging</b> is exactly what it sounds like: You step on a hold with the rubber on the edge
                            of your
                            shoe. You can use the inside edge, where your big toe offers stability on smaller holds, or
                            you can
                            use the outside edge. Your choice depends on the direction you need to move in order to get
                            on or
                            off the hold. <br> <br></li>
                        <li> <b>Smearing</b> happens when you don’t have an actual foothold, so you rely on your shoe’s
                            rubber
                            for friction against the rock. Smearing is useful in slab climbing, when you’re on low-angle
                            rock
                            without many defined footholds.
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    When you smear, look for small depressions or protrusions that will give a little extra friction.
                    You can also flatten out the angle for slightly better purchase.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Keep the following footwork tactics in mind when climbing:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Try to keep your feet directly below you.</b> Keep an eye out for footholds in good
                            positions, so you
                            can maintain better balance.</li>
                        <br>

                        <li><b>Look for foot placements even more than for handholds.</b></li>
                        <br>

                        <li><b>Once you set your foot, keep it still.</b> You’ll have a better chance of staying on the
                            hold as you
                            make your next move.</li>
                        <br>

                        <li><b>Keep your heel low so you have plenty of contact with the wall.</b> With a high heel less
                            rubber is on
                            the rock, reducing friction and increasing the odds that you’ll lever your foot off the wall
                            when
                            you make your next move.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h5> Climbing Techniques: Maintaining Balance</h5>
                    <img src="img/pic67.jpg" width="100%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When you’re lucky enough to have a line of jugs leading straight up the wall, climbing is pretty
                    intuitive. When you’re on a route where you have to move and pull in different directions, though,
                    you have to use your body to maintain balance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When you have to use a hold that’s out to the side, you can’t pull straight down. So you need to
                    find a way to counter the force of that side pull, so you don’t lose balance and barn-door off the
                    wall.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Balancing tactics:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Press your foot in the opposite direction of the pull to create counter pressure.</li>
                        <li>Pull in the opposite direction with your other hand or a hooked foot.
                        <li>Lean over hard and use your body weight as a counter balance.
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Climbing Techniques: Climbing Efficiently</h5>
                    <img src="img/pic68.jpg" width="100%">

                    <br>
                    Learn how to use less energy and how to give your muscles a break as you climb:
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Straight arms are happy arms.</b> Straightening your arm allows your skeleton to take
                            most of the
                            weight, not your muscles. Even a slight bend in your elbow means your muscles are working to
                            hold it
                            there.</li>
                        <br>

                        <li><b>Focus on your hips.</b> Beginners often keep hips squared to the wall, which can feel
                            very stable, but
                            it pushes your weight away from the wall and stresses your muscles.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Try to keep one hip pushed up against the wall.</b> That helps keep your weight over your
                            feet and lets
                            you lean back with straight arms.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Having a hip close to the wall brings your shoulder closer.</b> Your weight is over your
                            feet,
                            decreasing your chances of peeling off. A close shoulder also changes the angle of pull on
                            handholds, making them easier to grip.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b>Good climbers climb with their eyes.</b> Keep your eyes on the wall to look for holds
                            that let you take
                            a quick rest. Don’t just focus on the chalk marks.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>When you find a good rest, use it.</b> Allow your pulse to slow down and shake out your
                            arms so they
                            don’t get pumped later.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h5>limbing Moves</h5>
                    <br>
                    Having a good arsenal of climbing moves helps you solve problems and tackle more challenging routes.
                    Each of these moves employs principles covered in the technique section, above.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Back Step</h5>

                    <b>A back step is the opposite of a normal step. </b>
                    Instead of
                    stepping on a hold with your big toe and your hips squared to the wall, you turn your hip to the
                    side and step with the outside edge (little-toe side) of your shoe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Back stepping helps get your hip close to wall, making it easier to straighten your arms and take a
                    rest. It can also provide enough extension to reach an elusive hold. Back steps are especially
                    useful for saving energy on steep and overhanging routes. <br>

                    <h3> Drop Knee</h3>

                    <b>A drop knee is a more extreme back step.</b> It works best when you have a foothold near hip
                    level. Step
                    onto it with the tip of your toe; then roll your knee in until the outside of your shoe rests on the
                    hold and your knee actually points down.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just like a back step, a drop knee gets your hip close to the wall. It’s great for a rest, but it’s
                    especially great when you need extra reach on a steep or overhanging wall.

                    <br>
                    <h3>Stemming</h3>
                    <b> Stemming is pushing against two opposing surfaces. </b>This could be in a chimney, in a corner,
                    or on an
                    otherwise flat wall that has a big, protruding feature.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can stem using any combination of hands and feet, but the key is to use counter pressure to stay
                    in balance. Stemming relies on your big leg muscles, so it’s an extremely efficient way to climb,
                    and can give you some great rests.

                    <h5>Flagging </h5>

                    <b>Flagging is counter balancing by using a limb to shift your
                        weight.</b> The goal is to keep from swinging away from the rock.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Flagging is advantageous any time you’re using holds that are all on the same side of your body.
                    Because that also stacks all your weight to one side, you simply swing that leg out to the other
                    side of your body to keep yourself in balance.
                    <img src="img/pic72.jpg" width="100%">

                    <br>

                    <h3> Lay-backing</h3>

                    <b>Lay-backing is when you pull and lean off one side of a flake or a crack and push your feet
                        against
                        the other side.</b> When you have good footholds, laybacks are very efficient because your arms
                    are
                    straight and your feet do the hard work. When lack of good footholds requires you to smear, keep
                    your heels low to maximize the amount of rubber against the rock.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can use a lay-back any time you’re in a crack and jamming isn’t an option, or you’ve got an
                    opposing wall to push off against, like in a dihedral crack.

                    <br>


                    <h5>Mantle</h5>
                    <b> A mantle is when you push down on a hold and bring feet
                        up to meet hands.</b> A classic example of mantling is at the top of a climb when you need to
                    pull
                    yourself onto the ledge.


                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To mantle, push down on a hold to get your weight above it, then move your foot up to take the place
                    of your hand.
                    <br>
                    <br>


                    Mantles are necessary when you top out, but are also useful mid-climb when you have a big handhold
                    and you need to get your feet high.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>


                    <h5>Undercling</h5>

                    <b>Like the name implies, an undercling is when you use
                        the underside of a hold.</b> Using underclings may feel counter-intuitive at first, because
                    instead of
                    pulling down on the hold, you’re pulling up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One key to a good undercling is to find good, high footholds so you can maintain body tension by
                    pushing with your feet as you pull on the hold. Keeping your feet high puts the hold around waist
                    level and lets you keep your arms straighter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When done right, a good undercling gets you in a solid position to reach up for some extra
                    elevation.

                    <br>


                    <h5> Side Pull</h5>

                    <b>A side pull is any hold that’s oriented for a
                        sideways pull. </b>The key to a well-executed side pull is to balance out that sideways pull by
                    shifting
                    your body weight or by applying a counter force.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The position is kind of like if you were trying to open an elevator door; your elbow is bent and
                    pointing out to the side with your fingers pointing in toward you.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Like underclings, side pulls can feel awkward because you have to adapt the direction of your pull
                    to the orientation of the hold. But once that feeling clicks, suddenly you can use holds all around
                    you, not just those straight above.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The position is kind of like if you were trying to open an elevator door; your elbow is bent and

                    <br>


                    <h5> Gaston</h5>


                    <b> A gaston is the inverse of side pull.</b> In a side pull, the hold is oriented so that you pull
                    in,
                    toward yourself. A gaston is also oriented for a sideways force, but instead of a pull in, it
                    requires a push out.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The position is kind of like if you were trying to open an elevator door; your elbow is bent and
                    pointing out to the side with your fingers pointing in toward you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gastons may feel unstable because all the force comes from your shoulder. But adding this move to
                    your repertoire really opens up the wall.

                    <h5>Palming</h5>

                    <b>Palming is the hand version of smearing:</b> You push against the
                    rock with an open palm.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Palming can help you maintain balance while you reposition your feet. It comes in handy if no good
                    handholds are available. Palming is also useful when stemming because it allows you to apply counter
                    pressure to a blank face. And on slab climbs, fingers-down palming is especially helpful.

                    1. The Tallest Mountain of the planet earth is formed over 60 million years ago. As a result, Mt.
                    Everest is rising by 0.25 inches every year.
                    <br>
                    2. In 1865 the tallest peak gets its name as Mount Everest as the honor of British geographer and
                    surveyor Colonel Sir George Everest. It has other 2 Name SAGARMATHA and CHOMOLUNGMA in Nepalese and
                    Tibetan language.

                    The Himalayas mountains surrounded the major part of the subcontinent in the form of the head from
                    the Northern side. The mountains are expanded up to Gilgit. The name of one of the peaks of this
                    range is Nanga Parbat. Its average altitude is 8126 metres. The Himalayas protect our plains from
                    the cold wind of middle Asia. Moreover, they hinder the monsoon winds coming from the Arabian sea
                    and the gulf Of Bengal which cause rains. Most of the high peaks in this range are permanently
                    covered with snow. In the spring and the summer, the ice melts and provide water to our rivers. On
                    the southern hills of these mountains, there are forests of valuable Timber, the hill stations and
                    health resorts of Pakistan like Murree, Nathia Gali and valleys of Kaghan are situated in this
                    range. The valley of Kashmir also offers a beautiful view at the foot of these mountains.

                    In the west, there is a mountain range that begins from the Hindu Kush mountain range and is mostly
                    spread from north to south. Hill of the Swat, the white mountain hill of Waziristan, Suleman
                    mountain Kirther mountain are located in this range. Mountains are mostly dry and Barren. There are
                    important passes and rivers in these mountain ranges. Khyber Pass, Kurram Pass, Tochi Pass, Gomal
                    Pass and Bolan pass are important passes. Important rivers of this area are the Swat river, the
                    Kurram river, the Gomal river, the Bolan river, the hub river and the Lyari River. The Peshawar
                    Cantt and the Quetta Cantt are located near Khyber pass and the Bolan pass respectively. This pass
                    is served as transit routes between Afghanistan and Pakistan for the purpose of trade and travel.

                    Reaching a mountain summit is a mind-blowing experience, but what does it take to make it to the
                    top? Mountaineering covers everything from extreme backpacking on long but non-technical trails
                    through summit scrambling and ridge walking to hard-nut multi-pitch climbing up impossibly icy rock
                    faces.

                    Trips can last multiple months or be as short as a day, but whatever your distance you need decent
                    physical fitness, some technical know-how and, perhaps most importantly, the right mentality for the
                    challenge. If you’ve got that, then read these tips and go get started.

                    First off, get fit. Include walking and stair climbing in your daily routine, add regular running
                    and cycling to build base fitness and do weights to strengthen the upper body. Also, go to a
                    climbing gym to get a grasp of the basics, like being able to use a harness, belaying and tying into
                    a rope.

                    and build confidence on large crags and ridges, both alone and roped with a partner. Finally, get
                    comfortable doing all that in winter conditions – because mountaineering can be very cold.

                    <h5>2. Pick your target</h5>

                    <p style="color: darkgray;">Target the terrain and the exact difficulty of the climb you want.</p>
                    Consider what terrain you want to take on – technical routes, granite faces, glaciated mountains,
                    ice or mixed climbing or just walk-ups. Then plan long-term goals as well as setting out your
                    starting plans.
                    <br><br>
                    Climbs are graded by height – in 1,000m brackets from 4Kers to 8Kers – and a class system based on
                    steepness and exposure, with 1 flat and risk-free, 2 and 3 increasing in gradient and obstacles, 4
                    involving all-fours scrambling and 5 being highly technical with rock-climbing skills. Alpine grades
                    are similar, from F (Facile) through PD, AD, D, TD to ED (Extrêmement Difficile).
                    <br><br>
                    Also, don’t be over ambitious. It’s better to feel good about your achievements than be disappointed
                    you’re not hitting your targets.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h5>3. Take a course</h5>

                    <p style="color: darkgray;">A guide can teach you best practice and impart crucial mountain
                        knowledge.</p>

                    The ‘mountain bible’ Freedom of the Hills is a good place to start and if you have mountaineering
                    friends they can teach you the basics, but nothing beats taking a course. Going out with a guide
                    puts you in the mountains and gives you on-the-spot feedback and that crucial personal experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>Courses are usually six days on class 2-3 routes and cover route planning, navigation, safe
                    travel, rock climbing and logistics like weather analysis and mountain rescue. Some also cover snow
                    and ice, including techniques for self-arrest and glacier hiking. Having all these in your locker
                    helps you become more independent in your decisions on the mountain.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>4. Become master of the maps</h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/pic116.avif" width="100%">
                    <p style="color: darkgray;">Knowing how to read a map is crucial to high mountain survival</p>

                    The more navigation experience you have the better. Practise at home by plotting a course between
                    two points on any map. Plan real routes you can go out and do and find POIs you can navigate to. Use
                    all the tools – GPS, compass, altimeter, map contours, triangulation, bearings and sightings. And
                    once you’re confident, get lost and try to navigate back.
                    <br>
                    <br>Predicting your pace is crucial for planning as it helps avoid overdoing days and exhausting
                    yourself. Make sure you estimate well. Measure a distance on a path near your house and pace it out
                    – but pace hill walks too so you know how it changes when it gets steeper, higher and you get more
                    tired.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h5>5. Get the gear</h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/pic117.avif" width="100%">
                    <p style="color: darkgray;">The equipment has to be right for the type of mountaineering you do</p>

                    Layer your clothes, use merino-wool socks and boots with a hard outer and removable soft inner to
                    help you stay dry. Use a light backpack, just big enough to fit the basics. For climbing, get a
                    harness, helmet, the right length rope and a decent set of gear. And if you’re going on ice use
                    12-point semi-rigid crampons and a 60-90cm gently curved piolet axe.
                    <br>
                    <br>Take a headlamp, because mountaineering starts early and if you end up getting lost you don’t
                    want to be lost in the dark. Don’t skimp on a cheap tent or you’ll regret it if you’re hit by 120kph
                    winds, snow and ice. Be prepared for an emergency with bivvy gear and a small first-aid kit.
                    <br>

                    <br>

                    <h5>6. Prepare for altitude</h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/pic118.avif" width="100%">
                    <p style="color: darkgray;">Prepare your lungs for being at altitude</p>
                    Any 3Ker or above and you’re likely to be affected by altitude. Don’t take it lightly. At its
                    mildest, it can cause insomnia, lost appetite and nausea, all of which destroys your motivation and
                    fitness. At its worst, it can lead to pulmonary edema, which floods your lungs and can be fatal.
                    <br><br>Acclimatisation is vital. Go up slowly, climb high and camp low and the body can often work
                    things out. Rehydrate and eat, even if you don’t feel like it. And out on the trail, use pressure
                    breathing to regulate oxygen in the blood, slow your pace and take measured rhythmic steps. If you
                    get disoriented or develop a cough, descend as quickly as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h5>7. Plan, plan, plan</h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/pic119.avif" width="100%">
                    <p style="color: darkgray;">Leaving nothing to chance, be prepared for all eventualities</p>

                    Start local or in a well-travelled region with easy access to information and well-defined routes.
                    Plan days with pace in mind and don’t be too ambitious – a pitch or steep climb that looks easy on
                    paper is tougher at the end of a tiring day with a big pack, especially at altitude. Allow weather
                    contingency and always have Plan B in your pocket – quite literally.
                    <br>
                    <br>Permits and logistics (and visas if going abroad) all need precision planning and language
                    barriers can make things a lot harder.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="img/pic120.avif" width="100%">
                    <p style="color: darkgray;">Michal Sabovčík climbing at sunrise</p>

                    When you hit the trail, go before sunrise and head down by early afternoon, especially in icy
                    regions where sun melt increases the chance of rock falls through the day. Be flexible and adapt. If
                    you end up having to make an unplanned bivvy high on the mountain, you’ve overdone it.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h5>8. Build your skill set slowly</h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/pic121.avif" width="100%">
                    <p style="color: darkgray;">It's hard work, but you'll enjoy the ride when you complete a major
                        ascent</p>
                    Build up gradually and learn as you go. Never try something out for the first time on a big trip.
                    Practise skills in a safe environment and be confident in them before you need them. You don’t need
                    to be in the mountains – you can set up a crevasse rescue at home or an ice-axe arrest on a muddy
                    bank.

                    The Himalayas mountains surrounded the major part of the subcontinent in the form of the head from
                    the Northern side. The mountains are expanded up to Gilgit. The name of one of the peaks of this
                    range is Nanga Parbat. Its average altitude is 8126 metres. The Himalayas protect our plains from
                    the cold wind of middle Asia. Moreover, they hinder the monsoon winds coming from the Arabian sea
                    and the gulf Of Bengal which cause rains. Most of the high peaks in this range are permanently
                    covered with snow. In the spring and the summer, the ice melts and provide water to our rivers. On
                    the southern hills of these mountains, there are forests of valuable Timber, the hill stations and
                    health resorts of Pakistan like Murree, Nathia Gali and valleys of Kaghan are situated in this
                    range. The valley of Kashmir also offers a beautiful view at the foot of these mountains.

                        <br><br>
                        My glacier glasses get so foggy when I’m hiking up the Muir snowfield that it’s like my eyeballs
                        are in a sauna. How can I beat the steam and get my visibility back? Help!
                        <br><br>
                        Sincerely,
                        Blinded by the Exertion
                        <br><br>
                        ***
                        <br><br>
                        Hi Blinded,
                        <br><br>
                        We’ve all been there! Heavy breathing and eyewear are not a match made in heaven. However, there
                        are a few tricks you can use to prevent glacier glasses from fogging up in the future. First,
                        you need to understand why this happening. Eyewear typically fogs if there is not enough
                        ventilation or airflow around the face/head of the wearer.
                        <br><br>
                        Anti Fog Tip #1: Make sure you have the correct upper body and headwear layers on. If you feel
                        like you are overheating or getting very sweaty, glacier glasses will likely fog quicker.
                        <br><br>
                        Anti Fog Tip #2: Adjust the positioning of the glacier glasses on your face. Move glasses
                        further down your nose to allow more ventilation.
                        <br><br>
                        Anti Fog Tip #3: Try out “cat crap”, an anti-fog product for glasses and goggles. Apply it ahead
                        of time at your house. Weird name, but very effective
                        <br><br>
                        Hope this helps you see clearly now the fog is gone. You can see all obstacles in your way. Gone
                        are the dark clouds (of fog) that had you blind. It’s going to be a bright, bright, sunshiny
                        day.
                        <br><br>
                        See You in the Mountains,
                        Alpine
                        <br><br>
                        PS. All the Cat Crap in the world won’t make you look as cool as Dave Watson pictured above.

                        As part of our Guide Development Series, this next post focuses on the essential items to
                        include in your first aid kit if you are guiding an alpine climb.
                        <br><br>
                        Have you taken an opportunity to look into your med kit lately? Perhaps question why something
                        is even in there or maybe restock those used gloves that you forgot to toss out after your last
                        heroic medical incident? While the med kit is something that we consistently lug around as
                        guides it would be great if it was used just for that. Unfortunately, accidents happen and in
                        those instances all that time and effort we have put forth to assemble a bomber med kit proves
                        to be either sufficient or perhaps a little rough around the edges. Needless to say, it is not
                        rocket science and this blog post will address some key items to think about when determining
                        what to put in your very own med kit.
                        <br><br>
                        According to a report published in the National Library of Medicine on climbing accidents* falls
                        tended to be the leading cause of injury in alpine and rock climbing with extremities being the
                        most frequently injured body part. Despite all of the hazards involved in mountain sports,
                        accidents tend to be a rare occurrence – that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be prepared.

                        Most guiding companies begin hiring in the fall for the coming summer. We recommend applying in
                        October as most guides hire on a rolling basis and applying earlier gives you a slight
                        advantage. Specific information on our hiring requirements can be found here.

                        Alpine Ascents guide and woman about the Ouray Ice Park, Brooke Warren, is a backcountry snack
                        maestro. Known for creating a delicious symphony of flavors and textures, Brooke is on top of
                        the nosh game. If you are about to embark on a day of backcountry skiing or questing up
                        waterfall ice and need a bit of culinary inspiration – look no further. Life is too short (and
                        dental work too expensive) to gnaw on frozen Clif bars.

                        <b>Brooke’s Snack Bag</b>
                        <br><br>
                        Bengal Spice tea, some nut butters (have to be kept warm), a couple snack bars, leftover pizza
                        and vegan jerky. The one thing I was missing was something sweet (I usually like to include
                        Starburst or ginger chews), which I can eat while on the uphill to give me a boost of energy.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Snack Philosophy</b>
                        <br><br>
                        My snack philosophy is to bring a variety or textures and flavors: crunchy, smooth, sweet,
                        salty. I also like to bring enough small snacks so I can easily munch on something every time we
                        stop to transition or take a break. That ensures I never bonk and have energy throughout the
                        entire day.

                        As the bright sun pops over the shoulder of Mt. Hunter’s North Buttress the steam of our boiling
                        breakfast water curls up into the frosty blue Alaska morning. Soon, the drone of bright
                        DeHavilland Beavers and Otters bringing climbers into and out of the Alaska Range will fill the
                        sky. For now, though, we hear only the hiss of MSR Whisperlites and JetBoils, sometimes even the
                        jet-engine roar of an MSR XGK. My co-guide, students and I sit in the open-air kitchen and
                        seating area we have dug from the snow. Before us on the table is a buffet of breakfast choices.
                        <br><br>
                        So much of your day to day happiness in the mountains hinges on the food you choose to bring.
                        Once wheels are up on the tarmac in Talkeetna you have what you have – for better or worse.
                        Instead of relying on oatmeal and Freezy D’s – which are MUCH better than they were even a
                        decade ago and certainly have their time and place on climbing trips – you can build a varied
                        menu before you even board the plane to Alaska. Keep these two salient points in mind when
                        wandering the aisles of your local Safeway (or Stop and Shop, or King Soopers, or Fred Meyer’s,
                        or H-E-B…):
                        <br><br>
                        You are airplane camping. This is similar to the backcountry gourmet’s dream of ‘car camping’,
                        where you have such luxuries as a cooler and a tailgate. You have only to put the bag containing
                        your ingredients in a sled and drag them to camp, which is usually a few hundred yards from
                        where the airplane lands. You can ‘go heavy’ with certain items that would be off the menu if
                        you had to carry them in your pack.
                        <br><br>
                        The Alaska Range is covered in frozen water. Hundreds of feet of it, in fact. You can dig a
                        cooler and place perishable items inside. This both keeps foods cool and prevents more delicate
                        items from freezing in cooler overnight temperatures and turning to mush when they thaw. You can
                        make a prep/cooking area that allows you to sit or stand as you prefer. You can make a special
                        little cave for your spatula. The possibilities for organizing your culinary zone are endless.

                        As we made our way up the steep, northeast facing slope it became increasingly more difficult to
                        sidehill. The wind scoured snow morphed into ice and my gloved fingers gripped my poles a bit
                        tighter with every slip of my ski edge. We hoped switching to bootpacking would get us the rest
                        of the way since we were so close to reaching the peak but even kicking our boots in started to
                        become impossible. The weeks of snow drought and frequent melt-freeze cycles became all too
                        apparent when we finally made the collective decision to forgo the peak. Instead we transitioned
                        our skis, as well as our mindsets, to navigate our way out and back to a safe spot to dig snow
                        pits.
                        <br><br>
                        This type of group mindset is one of the things that makes the Alpine Ascents x SheJumps courses
                        such a special learning environment. The focus is on learning, safety, and community rather than
                        hitting that “sick line” or bagging peaks. “I loved that we took opportunities to learn and
                        discuss technical details without being objective focused-it was so great to tour with a group
                        that felt safe saying ‘this peak isn’t seeming great in these conditions, let’s get out safely
                        and go talk about snow science instead,’ ” recalled Kyra, one of the students attending the
                        AIARE 2 course.

                            accumulated experience-not just from individual mountain guides, but through
                            experience on particular mountains where details are fine-tuned over time.</p>

                            over five years, with a handful of veterans working with us for most of their
                            careers. The quality of our Guide Staff is the primary difference between us and
